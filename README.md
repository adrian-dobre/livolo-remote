# Livolo Remote Library (TX only) for Livolo RF switches.

## Thanks to the community
 Thanks kranjec.primoz@gmail.com for the research done on his blog https://neofoxx.com/post-4.html, kind3r@gmail.com for the keycodes (https://github.com/kind3r/livolo-rf-codes), Sergey Chernov for the initial Livolo lib (https://forum.arduino.cc/t/control-livolo-switches-livolo-switch-library/149850) and to all the awesome people that gathered various info here https://community.home-assistant.io/t/broadlink-rm-pro-livolo-switches-rf-learning-woes/12432 and here https://forum.arduino.cc/t/control-livolo-switches-livolo-switch-library/149850

## How to use it
The easiest way is to check the (blink example)[./examples/blink.ino]
Basically you need to init the library with the output pin 
```
LivoloRemote livoloRemote(4);
```
and then just sent the remoteId and button code
```
livoloRemote.send(6400, LivoloRemoteKey::BUTTON_5);
```
optionally you can specify the number of repeated commands, by default is 200
```
livoloRemote.send(6400, LivoloRemoteKey::BUTTON_5, 50);
```

Keycodes are provided via LivoloRemoteKey namespace, but you can send others if you want.

Some notes on remote IDs (from: https://github.com/kind3r/livolo-rf-codes/blob/master/src/broadlink.js):
 - valid remote IDs: 1 - 65500
 - valid dimmer remote IDs: 16384 - 32767


When transformed in binary:
 - 4 button remotes have an even number of 1's
 - full remotes have an odd number of 1's

Dimmer-able remotes have special IDs
 Assumption:
 - between 16399 and 32767
 - have at least 5 1's

Remote ids that work (*) or not with dimmer switches.
